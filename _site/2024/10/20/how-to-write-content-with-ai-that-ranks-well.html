<p>If you haven't revamped your content generation strategy by now, then you're falling behind. Whether you're running a personal blog or managing a team of writers, the emergence of AI has changed the way we create content. Those who adapt quickly will thrive, while others may struggle to keep up.</p>

<p>We've all heard the saying, "BS in, BS out." While this can apply to AI tools like ChatGPT, using strategic <strong>chatgpt prompts for content creation</strong> and carefully chosen keywords can deliver exceptional results.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll share the process I used to generate content that landed on page 1 of the SERPs within 10 days of publishing.</p>

<h2>1. Choose the Right Topic</h2>
<p>Before you start writing, think about the content you'll be creating. To ensure the page ranks, make sure there's search volume for your chosen topic, or you'll be writing for an audience that doesn't exist. The easiest topics to rank for often start with questions, such as "What is the easiest way to start a blog?"</p>

<p>To check if your topic has volume, search it in Google and look at the top results. If the SERPs are filled with relevant pages, you can assume the query has traffic. While highly competitive topics may be challenging, you can still outperform high-ranking pages by offering a fresh perspective, higher engagement, or a better user experience. Remember, AI will do the writing, but YOU provide the unique voice behind the bot.</p>

<h2>2. Keyword Research</h2>
<p>Keyword research is the most crucial step in creating content with AI that ranks well. Tools like SEMRush make this process simple but are also pricey.</p>
<p>If you have access, enter your topic into the Keyword Magic Tool and filter for relevant terms. You can also use the Domain Overview tool to analyze high-ranking pages for additional keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">For those without SEMRush, here are some alternatives:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 20px">
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://moz.com/explorer">Moz Keyword Explorer</a> (Paid)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator">Ahrefs Keyword Explorer</a> (Paid)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google Keyword Planner</a> (Free)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ryrob.com/keyword-tool/">Free Keyword Research Tool</a> (Free)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Outline Your Content</h2>
<p>The outline is essential because it forms the foundation of the AI prompt. The phrase "BS in, BS out" applies here: the better your outline, the better the AI-generated content. Break down the content into sections and guide the AI with your opinions to ensure the final piece reflects your voice.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intro</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Blogging Software Options</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Setup Guide</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Expand on each section and make sure you write into your outline anything that you want included in the final piece.</p>

<h2>4. Establish Credibility</h2>
<p>Important to note that this is a big opportunity for you to give a competitive edge to your final piece. By providing links to authoritative data sources in your outline, you encourage ChatGPT to incorporate them into the final piece. Google favors content from credible sources, so this step helps boost your page's authority both to Google and your readers.</p>

<h2>5. Generate Your Prompt</h2>
<p>With your topic, keywords, and outline in hand, you should be all set to choose a title for the article</p>
<p>You might already have one in mind but use your keyword list as your guide. Content with titles that closely align with a user's query will get a higher CTR on search engines every time.</p>
<p>Now generate your prompt.</p>
<p>I have published an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jordanlagan.com/2024/10/19/chatgpt-prompt-for-blog-post-writing">example prompt</a> on my website which you can check out here, but in general you should follow this basic format:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">Please help me generate a 500-1000 word article about "How to Start a Blog."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">The article should be easy to read and naturally incorporate the following keywords: <b>&lt;Your keywords&gt;</b> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">How to start a blog, how to start blogging, blogging setup tips. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">Here is the outline for the post:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px"><b>&lt;Your outline&gt;</b></p>

<h2>6. Adjust the Tone</h2>
<p>Generate multiple versions of your blog post. You may find that one paragraph is spot-on, while the rest needs tweaking. Piece together the best sections and adjust the tone as needed to align with your brand's voice.</p>

<h2>Final Tips</h2>
<p>Following these steps will get you 80-90% of the way to content that ranks well. Don't forget other important SEO factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix formatting once you have pasted the post into your content management system (add headers and paragraphs)</li>
  <li>Add inbound and outbound links (to boost crawlability and credibility)</li>
  <li>Include images (AI can help with this too)</li>
  <li>Write a meta description</li>
</ul>

<p>By implementing this strategy, you can use <strong>AI to write blog posts</strong> that rank well and attract traffic with minimal effort.</p>
