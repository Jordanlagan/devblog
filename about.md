# About Me

Hey I'm Jordan. Outside of work I am a part time pet sitter, baker, beer and coffee drinker, food lover and Costco enjoyer.

In 2023, I adopted a dog named Rosie and she has been the best thing to happen to me. I have a passion for taking pictures of her and she makes up 90% of my camera roll.

The other 10% of those pictures would be food / drink. My guilty pleasure is drinking smooth IPAs (funky but not bitter), Lattes with fancy chocolates, and splurging on expensive restaurants ðŸ¥¡.
