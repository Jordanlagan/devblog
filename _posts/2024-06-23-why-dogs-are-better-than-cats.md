## Cats are evil

I’m writing this with claw marks etched into my skin and a heart full of disdain. As someone who has faced the wrath of 500 cats—yes, you read that right—I'm here to tell you why dogs are undeniably better than cats.

It all started innocuously. A neighbor’s tabby wandered into my yard. I thought, "How cute!" That naivety cost me. Soon, I was the unsuspecting victim of feline fury. Big cats, little cats, and all in between; they came in hordes, their razor-sharp claws and teeth turning my once peaceful life into a nightmare. Each encounter left me more battered and bruised, but also more resolute in my newfound mission: to expose the truth about these furred fiends.

Dogs, on the other hand, are loyal, loving, and protective. They don’t plot your demise from the shadows or stare at you with those cold, calculating eyes. A dog’s bark might be loud, but it's a call for companionship, a sign of their undying loyalty. They greet you with wagging tails and slobbery kisses, not ambushes from behind the curtains.

Cats, however, are creatures of chaos. They knock things off shelves with malicious glee, scratch furniture, and leave you with nothing but scars and shredded nerves. They demand attention but on their own terms, flipping between affection and attack without warning. Living with cats is like having a tiny tiger in your home, constantly lurking, waiting to pounce.

My body bears the evidence of countless battles with these beasts. I’ve faced claws and fangs from every type of cat imaginable, and each experience has solidified my belief: cats suuuuuck. They are not the cute, cuddly companions some would have you believe. They are relentless, ruthless, and remorseless.

So, if you're contemplating a pet, remember this tale of survival and choose wisely. Dogs are the friends who will stand by you, while cats are the foes who might just end you. Choose dogs. They’re truly man’s best friend.
